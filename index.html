          I worked in multi-cultural teams with students from Austria and Italy.
          We developed business projects for Italian companies in multicultural
          teams. The project was connected with developing an entry strategy the
          Chinese market. We made an overview of China, market analysis,
          described distribution channels (traditional and online), customer
          behaviour, competitor analysis and offered the marketing plan, entry
          strategies and recommendations. The project was evaluated highly (28.5
